# Ecoacoustic IoT Project

This repository contains code and data for my ecoacoustic Internet of Things (IoT) project.

It includes:

- Acoustic data collected for ecoacoustic experiments  
- Signal-processing and analysis scripts for testing and evaluating the recordings  
- Source code related to IoT devices used in the project

The goal of this project is to explore low-power acoustic monitoring for environmental and wildlife applications.
