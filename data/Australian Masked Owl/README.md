# Australian Masked Owl Audio Clips

This folder contains WAV recordings of the **Australian Masked Owl** collected for our IoT ecoacoustics project.

The files are intended for:

- Training and testing machine learning models for automatic bird call detection and classification  
- Evaluating low-power / edge AI pipelines for long-term ecoacoustic monitoring  
- Experiments on data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation

Each file is a short audio clip (`maskedOwl.xx.wav`) that can be used in training, validation, or test datasets for ecoacoustic analysis.
